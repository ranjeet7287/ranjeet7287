 "I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of time"
Don't be scared of death, because most likely your physical death will lead to a new beginning.
Be scared of time, time for all of us 3 dimensional beings is running out, every second brings us closer to death, so while we have time, make the most of it.

We can die any time, so help someone, hug someone, do thing you've always wanted to do, talk to people, explore the world, relax.
Because when we die, all of that is over.
Don't die with regrets, and don't live with them either.
